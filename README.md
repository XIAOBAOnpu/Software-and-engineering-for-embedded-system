# Software-and-engineering-for-embedded-system
This is the project for BRUFACE SEES course

Uses ArduCAM ov5642 + Arduino Nano 33 BLE + PPG method for heart rate detection. Detailed explaination refers to Bao_Han_Anthony_Salim_Porject_Report.pdf

ArducamSrc folder includes files that makes ov5642 to operate in different modes

main_arduinoCode.ino is the main file

N.B. to properly run the program, ArduinoBLE, arduinoFFT and JPEGDecoder lib needs to be configured
